## Overview

A minimalistic challenge yet a powerful one to learn foundational knowledge whether for first time or revising your skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

I started working on the desktop design then proceed to the mobile design. Then I worked on the email validation and some other customization.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I have learnt more on how to interact with the Document Object Model(DOM). It made me explore the DOM world. I have also learnt how to work with CSS Grid and responsive design using the grid.

### Continued development

I will explore other CSS and JS frameworks and learn to be able do more complex layouts and logics.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me when I was working on email validation and DOM manipulation.
